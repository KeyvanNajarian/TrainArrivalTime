    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the pedestrian and traffic flow has been getting more attention in recent years. Understanding the patterns and behavior of people helped the engineers and scientists to optimize the design of the civil and building structures for pedestrian use; furthermore, it reduces the accidents related to flow of the pedestrians. Within the scope of the project CroMa, which aims to improve the functionality of train stations, this project tries to predict the trains' arrival time by analyzing the macroscopic behavior of the passengers' flow. Using the unsupervised machine learning algorithm, DBSCAN, the python program could achieve this objective."

    "### CroMa project\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "As passenger numbers are steadily increasing, new concepts are needed to increase the efficiency of train and subway stations. As part of the Crowd Management in Transport Infrastructures (CroMa) project, various measures, such as structural regulations, appropriate crowd management and, innovative, cross-organizational action strategies, are developed to increase the robustness of stations during peak hours. The underlying basis is comprehensive studies on pedestrian traffic in transportation facilities and on the behavior of passengers in large crowds. Observations at the train stations and experiences gathered from the crowd control at large event venues, both played a vital role in finding subtle flaws in the system and proposing a more effective solution. The derived facts and results from this project intend to improve the efficiency of the traffic facilities and reduce the crowds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partners\n",
    "The project CroMa is introduced by Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Many organizations have been collaborating for the project. Among them are University of Wuppertal, Juelich research center, Univeristy of Bochum, Deutsche Bahn AG, Schweizerische Bundesbahnen AG and federal police department.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Progress\n",
    "So far many experiments and researches were done and published. This work tries to continue the research \"KÃ¼pper, M.; Seyfried, A. (2020) Analysis of Space Usage on Train Station Platforms Based on Trajectory Data. Sustainability 12, no. 20: 8325\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The functionality of railway platforms could be assessed by level of service concepts (LOS).\n",
    "LOS describes interactions between humans and the built environment and provides the possibility of proper risk assesment due to overcrowding. To improve existing concepts, a detailed analysis of how pedestrians use the\n",
    "space was performed, and new measurement and evaluation methods were introduced. Boarding and\n",
    "alighting passengers show different behavior, considering the travel paths, waiting times and mean\n",
    "speed. Density, speed and flow profiles were exploited and a new measure for the occupation of space\n",
    "is introduced. The analysis has shown that it is necessary to filter the data in order to reach a realistic\n",
    "assessment of the level of service. Three main factors should be considered: the time of day, the times\n",
    "when trains arrive and depart and the platform side. Therefore, density, speed and flow profiles\n",
    "were averaged over one minute and calculated depending on the train arrival. The methodology\n",
    "developed in this article is the basis for enhanced and more specific level of service concepts and offers\n",
    "the possibility to optimize planning of transportation infrastructures with regard to functionality and\n",

    "### Objective of this work\n",
    "Following the above mentioned research, the main goal of this project is to predict the trains' arrival time according to the flow of the passengers. However, before discussing the method used to achieve the objective; Several points should be taken into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data collecting and preparation\n",
    "Data used for the analysis were tracking data acquired by stereo sensors provided by Swiss Federal\n",
    "Railways (SBB AG) for Zurich main train station, Switzerland; and German railways (DB) for Frankfurt main train station. The datasets were checked with respect to plausibility; nevertheless, completeness of the trajectories cannot be guaranteed. Due to technical reasons during recording, the tracking data are mirrored horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JuPedSim\n",
    "Juelich Pedestrian Simulator (JuPedSim) is an open source framework for simulating, analyzing and visualizing pedestrian dynamics. JuPedSim aids students and researchers to investigate pedestrian dynamics and focus on research. JuPedSim is currently focusing on evacuation, but is easily extendable to cover other areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "JuPedSim consists of four parts; jpscore for simulation, jpsreport for analysis, jpseditor for editing and jpsvis for visualization. In the previous work the trains' arrival time were detected using JPSVis manually, which is not a feasible detection way. The trains' arrival times considered the moments, which number of pedestrians disappear or appear on the edge of the platform. It was assumed that these people were getting on or getting off the train. The same approach for detection the passengers movement were used for this work as well. The JPSVis framework looks as below:\n",

    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what machine learning is, understanding the basic concept of artificial intelligence (AI) is a need. AI is defined as a program that exhibits cognitive ability similar to that of a human being. Making computers think like humans and solve problems the way we do is one of the main principles of artificial intelligence. AI exists as an umbrella term that is used to denote all computer programs that can think as humans do. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of machine learning algorithms, AI can develop tasks beyond what it was programmed to do. Machine learning, a sub-class of artificial intelligence can process large amounts of data and extract useful information, learn the patterns existing in the given data and improve upon their previous iterations by learning from their output. Statistics and calculus and linear algebra build the foundation of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the algorithm uses labeled data. Labeled data has both the input and output parameters in itself. So the algorithm can compare its result with the output parameter of the dataset. In supervised learning, the algorithm trains itself with labeled data. After the training, it predicts the output for unlabeled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised machine learning holds the advantage of being able to work with unlabeled data. the algorithm finds the relations and patterns in the input data. It cannot compare its output with the provided output from the dataset to optimize its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning directly takes inspiration from how human beings learn from data in their lives. It features an algorithm that learns from new situations using a trial-and-error method. "
